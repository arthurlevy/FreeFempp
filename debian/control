Description: PDE oriented language using the Finite Element Method
 FreeFem++ is an implementation of a language dedicated to the finite
 element method. It enables you to solve Partial Differential
 Equations (PDE) easily.
 .
 Problems involving PDE from several branches of physics such as
 fluid-structure interactions require interpolations of data on
 several meshes and their manipulation within one program. FreeFem++
 includes a fast quadtree-based interpolation algorithm and a language
 for the manipulation of these data on multiple meshes. It contains
 also a powerful mesh generation and adaption tool integrated
 seamlessly in FreeFem++ called bamg.
 .
 FreeFem++ is written in C++ and the FreeFem++ language is a C++ idiom
 allowing for a smooth learning curve.
