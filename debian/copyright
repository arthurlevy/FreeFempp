 The COOOL library is a free software. You can do anything you want
 with it including make a fortune.  However, neither the authors,
 the Center for Wave Phenomena, nor anyone else you can think of

 Since you've got the source code you can also modify the
 library to suit your own purposes. We would appreciate it 
 if the headers that identify the authors are kept in the
